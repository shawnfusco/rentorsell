# The Inflation Paradox in Mortgage Strategy

## The Key Insight: Inflation Helps Long-Term Borrowers

**Inflation erodes the value of debt over time.** This means:
- A $2,000/month payment in Year 1 feels expensive
- That same $2,000/month in Year 30 feels much cheaper (wages have gone up, prices have gone up, but your payment stayed the same)

## Strategy A: Larger Down Payment
- **Pays more money upfront** ($50,000 today)
- Smaller monthly payments over **full 30 years**
- Benefits from inflation: those monthly payments in years 20-30 are being made with "cheaper dollars"
- **Downside**: That $50,000 you put down could have earned returns elsewhere or been available for emergencies

## Strategy B: Extra Monthly Payments
- **Keeps cash** ($50,000 spread over time as extra payments)
- Pays off loan **faster** (maybe 22-25 years instead of 30)
- **Loses** 5-8 years of inflation benefit
- **Upside**: Saves significant interest by paying down principal faster

## The Inflation Paradox

At 3% inflation:
- $1,000 in Year 30 = ~$400 in today's buying power
- Strategy A's Year 30 payment feels like paying $800 instead of $2,000
- Strategy B already paid off the loan, missing those "easy" final years

## What "Today's $" (Real Cost) Shows You

The real cost calculation converts all future payments to present value:
- **Nominal cost**: Actual dollars you'll pay
- **Real cost**: What those dollars are worth in today's purchasing power

**Strategy A often wins in "real cost" because:**
- It maximizes the number of payments made with inflated (cheaper) future dollars
- The longer loan term means more inflation benefit

**Strategy B often wins in "nominal cost" because:**
- Lower total interest paid
- Faster payoff = less compounding interest

## The Bottom Line

- **Higher inflation favors Strategy A** (longer term, more inflation benefit)
- **Lower inflation favors Strategy B** (interest savings matter more)
- At 3% inflation, the strategies are often closer than people expect
- Your decision should also consider: opportunity cost of money, investment returns, peace of mind from faster payoff

**Tip**: Try adjusting the inflation slider in the calculator - you'll see the "real cost difference" changes significantly, while the nominal difference stays about the same!
